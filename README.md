# Gamecommerce 

## ðŸš§ Under Construction
Hello, and welcome to our under construction e-commerce platform repository! We're currently working hard to build a robust and user-friendly online store where you can sell game keys to your customers.

# Technologies
The platform is built with the following technologies:

Ruby on Rails: A popular and powerful web framework for building backend applications.
NextJS: A React-based framework for building fast and responsive frontend applications.
Redux: A predictable state container for managing complex application states.
...and more to come as the project evolves!

# Testing
We are committed to delivering a high-quality, bug-free product, and to that end, we aim to achieve 100% test coverage. We will be using various testing tools and frameworks, including RSpec and Vitest, to ensure that our code is thoroughly tested and ready for deployment.
